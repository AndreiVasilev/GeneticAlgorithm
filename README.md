# Phrase Evolution via Genetic Algorithm
This project is my first crack at object oriented programming. It is an implementation of a simple genetic algorithm that evolves a target phrase from complete randomness using the basic concepts of evolution: survival of the fittest and random mutation.

<h2>How It Works</h2>
The algorithm essentially creates an artificial environment. One which contains organisms that are forced to evolve within it. In the real world, organisms must evolve to cope with the environments in which they live. The organisms that are best at this tend to survive more often, and in turn procreate more often. Consequently, the genes of the best suited organisms become more and more prevelant from generation to generation. This process continues until random genetic mutations occur that prove to be even more advantageous. Soon enough, these mutations become the new norm, the older genes are overrun by the "new and improved" and the cycle continues.

As one can imagine, this type of algorithm can be implemented in many different ways. In this specific implementation, the "organisms" are character phrases and their "genes" are the characters that they each contain. The organisms which are the most likely to survive
