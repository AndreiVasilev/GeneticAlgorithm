# Phrase Generating Genetic Algorithm

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub! This project is my first crack at object oriented programming. It is an implementation of a simple genetic algorithm that evolves a target phrase from complete randomness using the basic concepts of Darwinian evolution.

<h2>How It Works</h2>
Genetic Algorithms attempt to evolve data to reach a preferred solution that works best.
Population Class
Phrase Class

<h2>Runtime</h2>
Affected by length of phrase, population size, and mutation rate.
